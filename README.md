Secure Chat Application

This project implements a secure chat application that integrates the Sliding Window Protocol for reliable data transmission with AES encryption to ensure data privacy. The application establishes a connection between two clients, allowing them to exchange messages securely over a network. The Sliding Window Protocol is employed to handle packet loss and ensure efficient data transfer by managing the flow of packets and retransmissions. To safeguard the confidentiality of the transmitted messages, AES-128 encryption is applied, providing robust security for the data exchanged between clients. The project encompasses a comprehensive approach to secure communication, combining network protocols with cryptographic techniques to deliver a reliable and encrypted messaging solution.
